AttackID: Cross-Site Scripting Attack
Severity: High
Title: "Site is Vulnerable to XSS"
AttackDescription: >
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. 
    XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different 
    end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the 
    output it generates without validating or encoding it.

    CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

Remediation: >
    The HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected 
    cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy 
    that disables the use of inline JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don't yet support CSP.

    Implement below Response headers on web-application: -
    "X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block"
    "Content-Security-Policy: unsafe-inline"
