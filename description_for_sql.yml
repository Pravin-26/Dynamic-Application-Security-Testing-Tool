AttackID: SQL Injection Attack
Severity: High
Title: "Site is Vulnerable to SQL Injection Attack"
AttackDescription: >
    A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. 
    A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute 
    administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file 
    system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL 
    commands are injected into data-plane input in order to affect the execution of predefined SQL commands.
