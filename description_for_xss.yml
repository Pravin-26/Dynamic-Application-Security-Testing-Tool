AttackDescription: >
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. 
    XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different 
    end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the 
    output it generates without validating or encoding it.
